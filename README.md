# Animated Landscape
An app to show my Core Graphics and animations skills

With this app I'm trying to share some skills that I learned in the last years.
Animated Ladascape is a beautiful way to see Core Graphics works with animations using QuartzCore library.

I created some views like flowers, mountains, sun, moon and stars in runtime execution. Changing all view colors dynamically depending on the sun's cycle.

To make the scene more complete I included a house gif using the FLAnimatedImage library.
